# DisPrimarySchoolAssessmentSoftware
The aim of this project is to assess and research the need for educational 
software for children of primary school age (aged 5 – 12) and the impact using 
computer-based software will have on children within an educational 
environment. Screen time use regarding children has always been a major area 
of contention for many the research within this project will attempt to evaluate the 
value of educational software and what criteria and practises will be best adhered 
to. Based upon the findings of research a development plan will be made to 
design, build, and evaluate an educational software application prototype that 
works for the benefit of children based upon how children learn by using imagery,
text and a combination of both.

The development will take place within the Unity game engine with use of 
Google’s Firebase platform.

The inspiration behind this was watching children during the COVID-19 pandemic 
lockdown fall behind in terms of education due to lack of availability of hardware 
or relevant software able to assist children in learning. During the pandemic the 
learning was confounded by not only the lack of available resources but also the 
lack of knowledge or training to operate the current software application offerings.
